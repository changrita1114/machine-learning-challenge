## machine-learning-challenge

### Background
Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

### Methods
Three machine/deep learning models, logistic regression(LR), random forest(RF) and neural network(NN) were used.

### Results
The NN has the highest accuray (0.91). The grid search scores of RF and LR are 0.89 and 0.89, respectively.

### Summary
The results are consistent with a previous study which showed that NN and RF showed a higher efficiency compared to LR (Pashchenko et al., 2018).
